# Weather-Project
Weather-Project, used to demonstrate my skills iOS dev

PROS:
- MVVM
- async/await
- NSLayoutConstraints
- Generic Network Layer

CONS:
Unable to test whether the cashed data was able to be loaded into the API for the apps relaunch. 
There were issues with the lifecycle functions, not being called, i used Xcode 14.3. Perhaps there is a bug
